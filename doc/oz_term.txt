==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                *oz-term-intro*

The Term module of oz-nvim provides an enhanced terminal interface for
executing shell commands. It features interactive command history, context-aware
suggestions, and deep integration with Neovim's quickfix list.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                    *oz-term-commands*

:Term [args]                                                *:Term*
:Term! [args]                                               *:Term!*
    Executes [args] in a new oz-term buffer.
    - If no [args] are provided, it opens a command wizard for selection.
    - Using `!` runs the command in the background (hidden).
    - Supports command-line completion for shell commands.
    - Commands starting with `@` (e.g., `:Term @make`) are executed from the
      project root.

:TermToggle [id]                                            *:TermToggle*
    Toggles the visibility of the oz-term buffer with the given [id].
    If no [id] is provided, it toggles the most recent terminal.

:TermClose [id]                                             *:TermClose*
    Closes the oz-term buffer with the given [id] and kills the associated job.
    If no [id] is provided, it closes the current or most recent terminal.

==============================================================================
KEYMAPS                                                     *oz-term-keymaps*

In an oz-term buffer, the following keymaps are available by default:

    <Enter>     Jump to the file/line under the cursor. Supports various
                error formats and also opens URLs.
    <C-q>       Grab all locations (errors, warnings, etc.) from the terminal
		output and populate the quickfix list.
    <C-r>       Rerun the command that was executed in this buffer.
    q           Close the terminal buffer. Prompts for confirmation if a job
                is still active.
    r		Run the executed command in root of the project.
    e           Edit the command that was executed in this buffer.

Global mappings (must be configured in |oz-nvim-setup|):
    Term        Open a prompt to execute a shell command.
    TermBang    Open a prompt to execute a shell command in the background.
    Rerun       Re-execute the previous command.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                               *oz-term-config*

The Term module can be configured via the `oz_term` table in `setup()`:
    - efm: Strings of |errorformat|.
    - root_prefix: Char which specifies the following command will run in the
    root of the project.

>lua
    oz_term = {
	efm = { "%f:%l:%c: %m" },
	root_prefix = "@",
    }
